<Biography><br>
Hi ! I'm currently a Senior Principal Architect at Marvell Technology since Aug 2024. Previously I was a Staff Applied AI Research Scientist @ Intel Labs working on Signal Processing and AI/ML algorithms design between Sep 2018 and Aug 2024. Prior to that, I was a Staff Systems Researcher at Qualcomm Research - Corporate R & D, San Diego between 2014 and 2018. Between 2003 and 2009, I held various positions at Intel Corporation and Samsung R&D Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 2014, advised by Prof. Syed Ali Jafar and my B.E.(Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India in 2003. At UCI, I worked on Information Theoretic Capacity characterization of Multi-user Interference networks with Non-generic channels. Over the last 2 decades, I've contributed to various product designs and features including but not limited to Samsung Kalmia Modems, Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets, Oneweb satellite systems, Intel FlexRAN, DARPA SpaceBACN.

              Thesis - <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/1640738434/F6E6CE26EEDB4CBFPQ/1">Interference Alignment : Beyond Generic Channels</a><br>
<br>
The radical idea of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55a5/76237f6573418ef93bc1fe3847554f7843c7.pdf">Interference alignment</a> enabled Capacity or Degrees of Freedom characterization (DoF, a first order approximation) for many multi-user  interference networks. Various alignment schemes provided fundamental insights into the number of accessible signal dimensions in communication networks where the output signals are linear functions of the input signals.<br>
<br>
Most of the prior art dealt with generic channels wherein the channel coefficients are assumed to be independent and drawn from a continuous distribution, continuous alphabet with infinite diversity, and the network is often single-hop. These assumptions were challenged due to the following reasons <br>
              <ul>
<li>Poor scattering in MIMO systems and network topology lead to spatial dependencies, manifested as rank deficient channels, </li>
<li>Multi-hop dependencies arise due to the presence of relays, and </li>
<li>Linear network coding applications (as in wired networks) act as finite field counterparts of wireless networks, with limited diversity.</li>
                </ul>
Hence, my research focus had been on characterizing the Capacity / DoF of linear communication networks with <b>Non-generic channels</b>, through the following three categories of networks. 
<br>
Single-hop Rank-deficient Interference channel: We found the DoF of the K-user MIMO rank deficient interference channel, with different ranks for the direct (D0) and the cross channels (D). For such rank deficient interference channels, it was shown that<br>
<ul>
  <li>The rank deficiency of direct channels does not help DoF and could hurt, while </li>
  <li>The rank-deficiency of cross-channels does not hurt DoF and could improve. </li>
  </ul>
The main challenge was to account for the spatial dependencies introduced by rank deficiencies in the interference alignment schemes that typically rely on the independence of channel coefficients. <br>

Multi-hop Rank-deficient Interference channel: We found the DoF of 2-hop MIMO rank deficient interference channel with different channel ranks in the first (D1) and the second hops (D2), for which a rank-matching principle was identified reminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. For this channel, the DoF loss was shown to be the rank-mismatch (|D1-D2|) between the two hops under moderate rank deficiencies. <br>

<br>
Finite field channels: Capacity results for the finite field counterparts of wireless networks were found, in order to explore the implications of channels being from a finite alphabet with limited diversity. By characterizing the capacity of constant finite field channels over Fp^n for 2-user X channel and 3-user interference channel, interesting parallels were drawn between p and SNR, and n and Channel Diversity.<br>
