              Hi ! I'm currently a Senior Principal Architect at Marvell Technology. Previously I was a Staff Applied AI Research Scientist @ Intel Labs working on Signal Processing and AI/ML algorithms design between Sep 2018 and Aug 2024. Prior to that, I was a Staff Systems Researcher at Qualcomm Research - Corporate R & D, San Diego between Oct 2014 and Aug 2018. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Sep 2014. I was lucky to be advised by Prof. Syed Ali Jafar in the EECS Department. I worked on Capacity / Degrees of Freedom (DoF) characterization of Multi-user Interference networks with Non-generic channels. I obtained my M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from UC Irvine in Sep 2011, and my B.E.(Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India in Jul 2003. Between 2003 and 2009, I worked at Intel Corporation for 1.5 years and later at Samsung R&D Institute for 4.5 years.

Research and System design for Oneweb Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Communication Systems - I worked on the design and analysis of Reverse link channels primarily on User Terminals. This was an adaptation of LTE air interface with single carrier waveforms enabling Satellite to Ground communication in Ka, Ku bands, which eventually got standardized as part of 3GPP Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) Standards. Previously, I contributed to Research & Design for Non-linear Interference Cancellation for Carrier aggregation usecases in LTE and 5G NR systems. Such carrier aggregation caused receiver desense due to harmonics and intermods within the receiver bands, which were digitally removed using suitable digital self interference cancellation mechanisms. These designs were commercialized in various Qualcomm Snapdragon Modem chipsets between 2014 and 2017, used by Apple, Samsung, LG etc..

              Thesis - Interference Alignment : Beyond Generic Channels<br>

The radical idea of Interference alignment enabled Capacity or Degrees of Freedom characterization (DoF, a first order approximation) for many multi-user  interference networks. Various alignment schemes provided fundamental insights into the number of accessible signal dimensions in communication networks where the output signals are linear functions of the input signals.<br>

Most of the prior art dealt with generic channels wherein the channel coefficients are assumed to be independent and drawn from a continuous distribution, continuous alphabet with infinite diversity, and the network is often single-hop. These assumptions were challenged due to the following reasons
Poor scattering in MIMO systems and network topology lead to spatial dependencies, manifested as rank deficient channels, Multi-hop dependencies arise due to the presence of relays, and Linear network coding applications (as in wired networks) act as finite field counterparts of wireless networks, with limited diversity.
Hence, my research focus had been on characterizing the Capacity / DoF of linear communication networks with Non-generic channels, through the following three categories of networks. 
<br>
Single-hop Rank-deficient Interference channel: We found the DoF of the K-user MIMO rank deficient interference channel, with different ranks for the direct (D0) and the cross channels (D). For such rank deficient interference channels, it was shown that<br>
The rank deficiency of direct channels does not help DoF and could hurt, while <br>
The rank-deficiency of cross-channels does not hurt DoF and could improve. <br>
The main challenge was to account for the spatial dependencies introduced by rank deficiencies in the interference alignment schemes that typically rely on the independence of channel coefficients. <br>
Conferences - Globecom 2012 , ISIT 2014    Journal - Trans on. Info Theory, Jan 2015 <br>              
Multi-hop Rank-deficient Interference channel: We found the DoF of 2-hop MIMO rank deficient interference channel with different channel ranks in the first (D1) and the second hops (D2), for which a rank-matching principle was identified reminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. For this channel, the DoF loss was shown to be the rank-mismatch (|D1-D2|) between the two hops under moderate rank deficiencies. <br>
Conference - Globecom 2014    Journal - Trans. on Info Theory, Sep 2015 <br>
Finite field channels: Capacity results for the finite field counterparts of wireless networks were found, in order to explore the implications of channels being from a finite alphabet with limited diversity. By characterizing the capacity of constant finite field channels over Fp^n for 2-user X channel and 3-user interference channel, interesting parallels were drawn between p and SNR, and n and Channel Diversity.<br>
